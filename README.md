# cassql
This is a personal project intended to help me gain a better grasp of how SQL works under the hood as well as improving command line usage of git. 
Intended scope should be a minimally viable set of select, insert, update, and delete functions on a table within a database, then will expand to proper relational database functionality.
Do people actually dislike #pragma that much?

# TODO
1: Finish parser; scanner works currently, need lexer
2: implement table; csv works as interim
3: implement select, insert, set, delete
